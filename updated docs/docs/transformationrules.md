# Transformation Rules

Transformation rules are manipulations that change the structure and semantics of data as it moves from source data to the target data. Functions applied on particular data elements of the report are called Transformation Rules. In case of any customization requirement, user just needs to specify which function should be used on the data elements and then they are implemented by Viper.
