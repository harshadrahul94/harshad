# Tags

 

Tags are used for classifying the business reports. The classification could be a department or any user defined value. By using tags, user can identify which map belongs to specific department. E.g.: Letâ€™s say a particular map is dealing with only Motor club data, we can add a tag as Motor club. Further then we can classify the tags more like motor truck data or motor club data by adding two separate tags. 

 

The concept of tags gives the flexibility to add departments and classifications without having to go through any product change.
