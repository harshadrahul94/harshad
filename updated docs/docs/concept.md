# What is VIPER?

VIPER stands for **V**ariable **I**nbound **P**rocessing and **E**xception **R**eporting. It is a software solution that has been specifically created for Fortegra for automating the various files and reports coming in for processing, extracting automatically from the email/ftp loactions, transforming it and sending it to the destinations automatically. The software not only increases the accuracy of the work but also decreases the time quotient to transform the file content. VIPER is a software that performs all the required transformations and the validations specific to the business process. VIPER supports data in various formats (csv, excel, datafiles, etc) and takes in charge of data enrichment and data transformation and generates the required data formats. Realtime Insights are generated using Microsoft PowerBI and proactive notifications generated if the expected bordereau, files or reports doesnâ€™t arrive via email or other methods, potentially savings weeks of delays.
