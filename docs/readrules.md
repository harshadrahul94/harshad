# Read Rules

Read rules are the rules or conditions that can be implemented if required according to the business process requirement to Viper which makes the entire process business specific and more accurate. There is a Fortegra standard format that has been agreed between Viper and the MGUs, anything that is not in the standard format and needs to be changed which requires read rules. The user can then add another sheet specifying the read rules according to the requirement and customise it for better and easier working. Read rules helps Viper to read the contents of the file.
